The payments name space contains resource collections for payments, sales, refunds, authorizations, captures, and orders.<blockquote><strong>Important:</strong> The use of the PayPal REST <code>/payments</code> APIs to accept credit card payments is restricted. Instead, you can accept credit card payments with <a href=\"https://www.braintreepayments.com/products/braintree-direct\">Braintree Direct</a>.</blockquote>You can enable customers to make PayPal and credit card payments with only a few clicks, depending on the country. You can accept an immediate payment or authorize a payment and capture it later. You can show details for completed payments, refunds, and authorizations. You can make full or partial refunds. You also can void or re-authorize authorizations. For more information, see the <a href=\"/docs/integration/direct/payments/\">Payments overview</a>.
